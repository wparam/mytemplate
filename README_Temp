# Project XXX

XXX is a Text-to-SQL chatbot designed to answer soccer-related questions. It translates natural language queries into SQL commands to retrieve relevant information from a cloth database.

## Configuration

The `src/config.yaml` file contains the configurations for API keys and database connections. Ensure you update this file with your specific API keys and database credentials before running the chatbot.

```yaml
api_keys:
    openai: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    other_service: YOUR_OTHER_SERVICE_API_KEY

database:
    host: YOUR_DATABASE_HOST
    port: YOUR_DATABASE_PORT
    user: YOUR_DATABASE_USER
    password: YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD
    name: YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
```

This function connects to a PostgreSQL database and performs operations on it.


# Data Tables
Tables are created with the notebook in `notebooks/001-create-postgresql-initial-tables.ipynb`.


To run this script, execute the following command:
```python
python src/main.py
```

This will start the application and perform the necessary operations as defined in the main function.


# UI
The user interface is built with Gradio, allowing users to ask questions directly to the database.
